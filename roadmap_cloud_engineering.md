# Ways of the Code - Cloud Engineering Roadmap

Welcome to Ways of the Code, where you will learn Cloud Engineering and the tools of the trade.  

This roadmap will give you a general overview on the resources that are important to lear while making sure you do not get lost inside the forest of resources that are available.   
There is never one way to learn, but this will be a collection of resources that I used and deemed valuable.   
Hopefully you will like it too.  
During this course you will start to notice that Cloud Engineering is about building beautiful things with glue, rubber bands and ductape.  

__DISCLAIMER__
Most of the resources I provide are for free.  
If couldn't provide a link, there is a way to get it for free but please consider supporting the writers of the book.  
Even if it is free, still consider supporting providing the providers for their book.  

## Ordered logically-chronologically

### Setup

First step of doing business, is getting everything set up.  
Read and follow along the 'wotc_cloud_engineering.md'  
This will be your guiding spirit for following along with the bootcamp.  

### Absolute basics

We start with learning how Linux, the most used operating system for the Cloud, works.  
Learning both a bit about the operating system and the BASH shell, which allows you to do loads of simple tasks very efficiently.  

One of the best books for learning how Bash works and learning parts of Linux on the side of it.   
A well organised, easy to comprehend book that gets you from knowing zero to having a decent grasp on it.  

The Linux Command Line by William Shots

_Optional_  
For more in depth knowledge on how Linux works, I recommend How Linux Works.  
This is a tough book that will get you into to more nitty gritty of Linux.
