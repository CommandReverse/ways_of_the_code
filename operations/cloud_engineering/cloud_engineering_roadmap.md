# Rome - Cloud Engineering Roadmap

Welcome to Rome, where you will learn Cloud Engineering and the tools of the trade.

This roadmap will give you a general overview on the resources that are important to lear while making sure you do not get lost inside the forest of resources that are available.  
There is never one way to learn, but this will be a collection of resources that I used and deemed valuable.  
Hopefully you will like it too.  
During this course you will start to notice that Cloud Engineering is about building beautiful things with glue, rubber bands and ductape.

**DISCLAIMER**
Most of the resources I provide are for free.  
If couldn't provide a link, there is a way to get it for free but please consider supporting the writers of the book.  
Even if it is free, still consider supporting providing the providers for their book.

## Ordered logically-chronologically

### Setup

First step of doing business, is getting everything set up.  
Read and follow along the 'wotc_cloud_engineering.md'  
This will be your guiding spirit for following along with the bootcamp.

### Absolute basics

We start with learning how Linux, the most used operating system for the Cloud, works.  
Learning both a bit about the operating system and the BASH shell, which allows you to do loads of simple tasks very efficiently.

One of the best books for learning how Bash works and learning parts of Linux on the side of it.  
A well organised, easy to comprehend book that gets you from knowing zero to having a decent grasp on it.

The Linux Command Line by William Shots

_Optional_  
For more in depth knowledge on how Linux works, I recommend How Linux Works.  
This is a tough book that will get you into to more nitty gritty of Linux.

### Container, I just met her

Once you got past the basics of Linux, it is a good idea on knowing how
containers work and differ from the Virtual Machine you used in the basics.

### Cloud basics

Let's start by understanding the cloud.  
We are going to make use of Microsoft Azure but anyone is free to pick whatever cloud platform they prefer.  
Azure luckily has both a Learning Path and certification for it.  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900

And our favorite resource FreeCodeCamp got you covered there too.  
I recommend using both the Azure Learning Path and the FCC one to see what
sticks the best with you.

### Data Basics

We are also going to start with the Data Fundamentals from Azure.  
This will be a stepping stone to become a Data Engineer Associate.

Follow this learning path that will get you rolling fast.

Yet again FreeCodeCamp has supplied the goods.

### Data Manipulation

For learning on how to work with data and manipulating it, it recommend  
starting with learning numpy and pandas for the basics.  
I fully recommend Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney.
