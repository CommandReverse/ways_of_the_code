# Ways of the Code - Python Roadmap

Hi there, 

I am CommandReverse / SleepyMarauder and I am glad to meet you.
This is going to be a roadmap to bring you from not knowing how to program to knowing the 'Ways of the Code'.

Instead of paying a lot of money I will teach you for free.
First language up, the allmighty and popular Python.

__DISCLAIMER__
Most of the resources I provide are for free.
If couldn't provide a link, there is a way to get it for free but please consider supporting the writers of the book.
Even if it is free, still consider supporting providing the providers for their book.

## Ordered logically-chronologically

### Setup

First step of doing business, is getting everything set up.
Read and follow the 'wotc_python.md' 
This will be your main line for following along the bootcamp.

### Absolute basics and then some

During a paid course from work I met a nice teacher who taught our class the basics from this book called 'The Coders Apprentice'.
We did only the first chapters and I finished the rest on my own. Frankly, this book is a 10/10.

## A tough starters course

Introduction to Computer Science and Programming taught by Eric Grimson is an absolute jewel.
Far from being easy and if you just got started with Python / did not know the language probably would have been too much.
Especially if you follow along with the timeline provided by Edx.

However if you know the basics of Python, you will enjoy this and gain more confidence not only in your Python skills but your CompSci skills.

I can recommend buying the accompanying book by John Guttag
https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-third-edition

MIT 6.00.1
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/

## Are you Serious

The book called Serious Python is a magnificent follow-up and will allow you to progress much better in honing in your Python Skills.
It is $19 dollar, so not that expensive.

Recommendation for an alternative:
Practices of the Python Pro.
Even though you can buy it, Manning allows you to read it online for free.
https://www.manning.com/books/practices-of-the-python-pro

Either one of these books will get you to the next level. Having a more solid understanding of how to program in Python.

## Project time!

Learning is fun but do not forget that learning is the means to gain the knowledge so you can realise your dreams.
There are many types of project but consider the following:
- Create a simple webapp in Flask
- Create a simple game in PyGame
- Create a decent CLI ( Command Line Interface ) with ArgParse / sys.argv

## Tough Course 2 - Electric Buggaloo

Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science by John Guttag.
While not for the faint of heart, you should be able to clear this course easily with your gained knowledge.
The Python language is your friend now and you need to take on the beast that is CompSci.
There are a few tough concepts in here, but with persistence you'll own this course.

I can recommend buying the book from MIT press

## Branching out

For web development I suggest picking up the micro framework Flask.
Michael Grinberg is a great writer and the accompanying code makes this a good practice project and learning experience.

For data science I suggest picking up the following books:
Data Analysis with Python by Wes McKinney
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/
The Data Science Handbook by Jake Vanderplas
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/

or just your own interests.
MicroPython - Control the world with microcontrollers
https://micropython.org/

## Hardmode Activated

The mother of all giant books.
Fluent Python is far from being simple but it isn't meant to be.
A real in depth, well-written book that explains many concepts that you probably did not even know was there.
But with this gained knowledge you will be a true master of Python.

## Everything you want to know

The allmighty python docs of course.
Every piece of the standard library, PEP's and much more is explained in here.
A vast resource, a true swamp. Do not get lost. 
Google FU is your friend.
