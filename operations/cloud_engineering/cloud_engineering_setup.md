# Ways of the Code - Cloud Engineering Roadmap   
   
Welcome to Ways of the Code, where you will learn Cloud Engineering and the tools of the trade.   
   
This bootcamp will give you a general overview on the resources that are important to lear while making sure you do not get lost inside the forest of resources that are available. There is never one way to learn, but this will be a collection of resources that I used and deemed valuable.    
Hopefully you will like it too.   
   
__DISCLAIMER__   
Most of the resources I provide are for free.   
If couldn't provide a link, there is a way to get it for free but please consider supporting the writers of the book.   
Even if it is free, still consider supporting providing the providers for their book.   
   
## Well what is Cloud Engineering anyway?   
   
Cloud Engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computing according to a simple Google.   
That doesn't say much, does it.   
In my humble opinion it concerns with designing, building, deploying and maintaining solution in the cloud.    
   
There are many cloud providers but the big three are Amazons AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A cloud is a bunch of hardware that isn't your concern anymore.   
What you are concerned with is interacting with the software / os part.   
   
The simplest ways of transfering to a cloud environment is to 'spin up' a virtual machine just like you would on virtualbox. But there are many more solutions.   
   
## Which provider should I pick   
   
A tough one and I am not going to be the one who makes this decision for you.   
I can recommend either one of the big three but I am most familiar with Azure Cloud due to it being an obligation from work.    
   
In the end most Cloud environments are quite similar with some differences which you will pick up when you get the gist of it.   
   
__DISCLAIMER__   
For this course I am going to work Azure Cloud to explain what you need to know.   
Many tools I use are vendor agnostic so it should not matter that much.   
   
## Setup   
   
To understand the cloud, you need to understand how servers work.   
Most servers, around 98% if I recall correctly, are running Linux so that is where we are going to start.    
   
Either install Linux as your main driver or install it on a virtual machine ( VM ).   
For a virtual machine, I recommend using virtualbox. That is what I am most experienced with.    
   
https://www.virtualbox.org/    
   
Download a distribution of Linux. For beginners it is often recommend to pick something like Ubuntu, Debian, ElementaryOS, Linux Mint or other easier to install and manage distrubutions.    
   
My recommendation is Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate or Kubuntu.   
Currently I am running Kubuntu, which is ubuntu with the KDE desktop environment.

https://ubuntu-mate.org/   
https://kubuntu.org/   
   
After Virtualbox has been downloaded, you start installing your downloaded .iso file.
